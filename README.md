# Simple Forum Application

This is a basic forum application built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). The main goal of this project was to explore **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** concepts and integrate modern technologies like **Prisma**, **Redis**, and **Cloudflare R2** for image storage. It was designed as a learning project and is not intended for production use.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive framework for building scalable Node.js applications.
- **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM for efficient and type-safe database access.
- **Redis**: Used as a caching layer to enhance application performance.
- **Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)**: For handling file uploads and image storage.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing and robust development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

This project follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** inspired architecture, with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain**: Contains business rules and domain models.
- **Application**: Use cases and application services.
- **Infrastructure**: Database repositories, cache implementations, and external integrations.
- **Interface**: Responsible for routes and adapters (controllers in NestJS).
